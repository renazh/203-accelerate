== Description ==

**The only plugin you need to move from Blogger to WordPress**

Blogger Importer Extended is the easiest way to import your posts, pages, tags, comments, images and authors from **Blogger to WordPress**. After the import is complete, you can also enable 301 redirects from old Blogger links.

Import up to 20 blog posts/pages, along with all comments, featured images and post labels for free. If you have more than 30 blog posts, you may wish to purchase an [unlimited license](https://www.pipdig.co/shop/blogger-importer-plugin/). This allows you to import an unlimited amount of posts, pages, comments, images, labels and authors. You can also choose from a range of options to help with things like SEO and content formatting.

Blogger Importer Extended can:

* Import published posts
* Import pages
* Import tags/labels
* Import comments
* Import images (high res when available)
* Import authors
* Preserve all post/page links
* Automatically remove "?m=1" from old Blogger links
* Filter links from spam comments (good for SEO)
* Setup all 301 redirects from Blogger to WordPress
* Fix mixed-content (convert http to https)
* Convert post content formatting to match WP standards

"I have a huge blog with over 3,800 posts and I was skeptical that it would be imported, let alone be imported well. My skepticism was unfounded. Not only did it move all the posts to my new WordPress Blog but with all the images, all the type definitions, and all the links that I am aware of. I am way beyond pleased. I am thrilled. I will be using this plugin for many of our companyâ€™s blog transitions. Thank you for building this outstanding tool. You have my full appreciation." - [Review from terryminion](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wow-im-blown-away/)

== Why is the free version limited to 20 posts? ==

The Google Blogger API has a limited quota per day. Offering 20 free imports should be enough for most personal blogs without hitting the Google API quota limit.  If you have more than 20 posts, or simply want to support the plugin, you may wish to purchase an [unlimited license](https://www.pipdig.co/shop/blogger-importer-plugin/).

== What is the difference between Free and Unlimited? ==

With the free version, you can import up to 20 blog posts/pages, along with all comments, featured images and post labels. If a post has more than one image, the first image will be downloaded to the media library and set as the featured image. The remaining images will still show in the post content, however they will be hosted on Google rather than WordPress.

With the unlimited version, all content is imported into WordPress (unless you select the option to exlude them). There are no limits on the number of posts, pages, comments, images or labels. The only thing which is not imported is draft or sheduled posts.

With both versions, you can setup all the required 301 redirects from Blogger to WordPress.

== What if I have 1,000,000 blog posts? ==

Wow, that's a lot of posts, nice work! If you want to import more than 20 posts, please consider purchasing an [unlimited license](https://www.pipdig.co/shop/blogger-importer-plugin/). This allows you to import as much as you like. The importer can handle any number of posts you have.

If you have a large blog, you may wish to consider using our full [Blogger to WordPress migration service](https://www.pipdig.co/shop/blogger-to-wordpress-migration/). This covers all aspects of the migration from start to finish.

== Can I use it on more than one site? ==

You can use the both free or unlimited version on all your sites. If you purchase an [unlimited license](https://www.pipdig.co/shop/blogger-importer-plugin/), you can use it for all your own projects.
